# Ping, ICMP View
[ICMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Control_Message_Protocol) allows a high level analysis of the current network conditions. The input field allows entering the target IP address as well as options of the ICMP command. If logging is enabled, the results of the ICMP test are pushed to the InfluxDB and can be viewed in the dashboards. The most relevant KPIs gathered here are:
* packet loss
* RTT round trip time
