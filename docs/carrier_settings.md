# Carrier Settings View
This view allows to read out and filter the current settings used by the phone for the currently used subscription. Those settings tell the phone how to behave in the specific network. This list of settings displayed here can be very long and differs from phone to phone. To alter the most relevant settings, please see [Settings -> Mobile Network](settings/mobile_network.md).
