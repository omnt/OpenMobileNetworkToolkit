# Special Codes View
This view, if carrier permissions are granted, allows sending so-called Secret or Special Codes via the dialer API. Those codes are mostly vendor specific or even device specific and either enable hidden features or open developer menus. If carrier permissions are not granted, those codes can also be entered into the system dialer. Some vendors e.g. Samsung don't allow this in their custom dialer, but it's usually possible to install the Google dialer from play store and make this the default dialer.
