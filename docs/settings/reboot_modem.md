# Reboot Modem

[Home](../OpenMobileNetworkToolkit.md)

The ```reboot modem``` button, carrier permissions required, triggers a reboot of the modem / baseband of the phone.
This usually affects all subscriptions / SIM cards / mobile network connection.

Usually this is faster than toggling airplane mode and might also be a deeper reboot.
